# README: Portfolio Rebalancing Simulation

### Project Title
Portfolio Rebalancing Simulation in R

### Description
This project involves the development of a stock portfolio rebalancing algorithm using R. The algorithm optimizes returns through simulated investment strategies in a portfolio containing 10 high-tech stocks. The project also compares the effects of different rebalancing intervals (3-day and 5-day) on the portfolioâ€™s value over a 6-month period.

### Key Features
Portfolio Construction: A $5 million portfolio invested equally in selected stocks.

Rebalancing Strategy: Simulation of stock rebalancing based on changes in adjusted closing prices.

Performance Improvement: The strategy achieved up to a 4% increase in portfolio value.

Currency Analysis: The impact of currency conversion (USD to JPY) on portfolio performance.

### Tools & Libraries Used
Programming Language: R
Libraries: ggplot2, dplyr, broom, glmnet
 
### Files
PortfolioRebalancing.R: Main script implementing the portfolio rebalancing strategy.

StockData/*.csv: Historical stock data for each company in the portfolio.

README.md: This documentation.

### How to Run
Clone the repository and place the stock data files in the StockData/ directory.

Open and run PortfolioRebalancing.R in RStudio or an R environment.

The script will generate visualizations and output performance metrics.
